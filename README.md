# üöÄ SkillCraft Technology - Dynamic & Aesthetic Website

This repository contains the complete front-end code for the **SkillCraft Technology** marketing website, built as part of an internship task. The primary focus was creating a high-quality, professional, and visually rich user experience centered around an interactive, fixed navigation menu.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

This single-page application (SPA) showcases several modern front-end design and interaction principles:

### 1. Dynamic Fixed Navigation

The navigation bar uses **CSS `position: fixed`** and **JavaScript** to deliver a premium user experience:

* **Fixed Position:** Always visible, ensuring smooth navigation across all sections.
* **Scroll Interactivity:** The navigation bar transitions from a **semi-transparent** overlay (on the hero section) to a **solid, dark, deep-charcoal background** once the user scrolls past the 50px threshold (`script.js`).
* **Hover Effects:** All menu links change style/background color on hover, providing clear visual feedback.
* **Aesthetic Look:** The company name, **SkillCraft Technology**, is prominently displayed.

### 2. Rich, Aesthetic Design

The website moves beyond generic "AI-generated" styles by using a sophisticated and professional color palette:

* **Color Scheme:** Utilizes a rich combination of **Deep Charcoal/Slate** (`#36454F`), **Rich Teal** (`#008080`), and **Warm Gold/Amber** (`#FFB347`) for accents and Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
* **Visual Depth:** Cards feature subtle **lift effects** (`transform: translateY(-8px)`) on hover and **rich shadows** to give elements a premium, three-dimensional feel.

### 3. Detailed & Engaging Content

The page is filled with necessary content to demonstrate a complete, professional web presence:

* **Services Section:** Features a grid of four visually appealing cards detailing core business capabilities.
* **Portfolio Section:** Includes a grid of four project examples with technology **tags** (React, AWS, Python, etc.), adding depth and realism.
* **Hero & About:** High-contrast sections using impactful typography and the chosen color palette.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure and Semantic Markup.
* **CSS3:** Styling, utilizing custom properties (`:root`) for easy theme management, flexbox, and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Used specifically for the scroll detection and class toggling functionality.
* **Font Awesome:** For professional, scalable icons across the service and portfolio cards.
